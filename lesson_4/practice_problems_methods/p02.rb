yep = ['ant', 'bat', 'caterpillar'].count do |str|
  str.length < 4
end

# doc says .count will return integer based on boolean of each iteration
# one element length is more than 4; so return will be integer 1

p yep

# that's a less than sign.. so how many element lengths less than 4..
# which is 2.. BUT I MEAN I DID GET THE CONCEPT RIGHT!!
