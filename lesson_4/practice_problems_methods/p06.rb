p ['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# immediately think it should be 1
# .pop destructively removes last element and returns it..
# so ['catepillar'].size is 1.. the original array is size 2 now

# AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... kinda maybe close

# if i looked at documentation I wouldn't have to assume..

# array.pop returns a string.. not a 1 size array..

# so 'catepillar'.size is counting the chars which is 11

# OOOOOOOOOOOPS
