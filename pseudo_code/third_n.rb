# given string should be split into individual characters
# variable should be assigned to user input for what is desired
# define a counter variable that starts at 0
# counter should iterate by +1 as code iterates through string searching for desired
# when counter is 3, print the current index
# if code iterates through the whole string and counter does not equal 3 return nil
