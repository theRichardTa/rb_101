=begin


- input is a string GIVEN
- output is all substrings which are palindromes (array?)

- palindromes case sensitive
- spaces don't matter so a pattern in the middle of the string counts
- strings count (nestedly?) a palindrome inside another counts.. so don't remove
  it without analyzing
- don't return anything if no palindromes
- return nothing for blanks

hmm
