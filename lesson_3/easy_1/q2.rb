# in ruby ! achieves the opposite.. for example != would be does not equal
# ? in ruby is asking "if" or "does".. 5 == 0 ?..code

=begin

1. != does not equal.. good for conditionals to go down a certain route

2. i'm actually not sure off the top of my head..
-- this is like the double !! turning a truthy statement into boolean true
--- BUT INSTEAD.. it returns the opposite as a boolean
--- SO: !nil => true .. for example

3. becomes a destructive / mutating method (if it exists)

4. again idk
-- oh it's in the whole context of something ? this1 : this 2

5. asking if it's true.. boolean answer

6. turns truthiness into boolean true.. or falsiness/nil actually
